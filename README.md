Noto
----
Noto is my senior project (CIS 4914) at the University of Florida. It is going to be a plain-text note-taking application that interprets Markdown-esque markup into HTML with a language support for simple diagramming. The output will be formatted webpages that provide easy to read and accessible means of reviewing and distributing notes.

Cheers!
